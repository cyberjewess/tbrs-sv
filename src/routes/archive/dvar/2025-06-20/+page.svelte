			<strong>Stories</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>12 Spies</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							They're in the desert after Sinai - God tells Moses to pick 12 spies, they go into the
							land - they come back saying it's a land of milk and honey with big scary giants -
							everyone freaks out but Caleb and Joshua - God says you will wander in the desert for
							40 more years, only Caleb and Joshua enter the land - the other spies die of plague
						</li>
						<li>The weeping of the Israelites is, traditionally, the reason for Tisha B'Av</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Also there's tzitzit</strong></li>
				<li>
					<strong>Rahab</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Joshua sends two spies into Jericho - Rahab hides them, let them escape - Rahab
							demands protection for her family/clan, and is rewarded with it for assisting in the
							destruction of Jericho - later on, the Israelites will exterminate all the human
							beings and livestock in the city
						</li>
						<li>She's seen as a worthy convert, some rabbis attest she marries Joshua</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<strong>Joshua and Zionism</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Joshua was unpopular for years, especially after the Christians took him up</li>
				<li>
					Rachel Havrelock, The Joshua Generation
					<ul>
						<li>
							Occupation (kibbush), settlements in the West Bank (hitnahalut), border (gevul),
							Zionist pioneers (Halutzim, the name for the infantry in Joshua 4:13)
						</li>
						<li>
							According to Ben-Gurion, Jews could not correctly interpret Joshua before the rise of
							the State of Israel.
						</li>
						<li>Ben-Gurion has a study group in his home in 1958, which is publicized</li>
						<li>
							Yigael Yadin claims archaeological proof that the war was in 1200-1250 BCE and created
							a pure monotheistic society formed by the descendants of liberated slaves.
						</li>
						<li>
							the book of Joshua supports militarization of the settlement process by way of verses
							that castigate tribes for their failure to annihilate their neighbors
						</li>
						<li>
							Names for settlements come from Joshua as well, Ofra (1975) and Mitzpeh Yericho (1977)
							which both boldly claim themselves as biblically predestined, on the same land, and to
							be the flagships of a movement
						</li>
						<li>
							1993, Moshe Levinger's Ichud Rabbanim group respond to Oslo: Insisting with Joshua
							locution that "all" the land belongs to "the entire" Jewish people across all time,
							the ruling invalidated Israeli elections and rejected the authority of state
							representatives
						</li>
						<li>Evangelical protestantism as Jewish interpretation of Joshua</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Does not feel very Jewish to me! Both Levinger and Ben-Gurion - text alone</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>What should we do with Joshua?</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Rejection</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							S. Yizhar: The horrific descriptions in the book of Joshua, where one inherits,
							dispossesses, and annihilates a people, and calls it a "settlement." How does one
							people have the right to dispossess another people and inherit its land?... This is
							the extreme of radical fanaticism that has been known throughout history... This is
							why, with all my might, I rise up in revolt against Joshua
							<ul>
								<li>Suggestion that Israel is no different from any other conqueror of the land</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Historical interpretation?</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The book says it itself, kind of: No amount of violence can render Jerusalem
							homogeneous
						</li>
						<li>
							Canaanites, Jebusites and everyone else were not likely ethnically or racially
							different from the tribes of Israel
						</li>
						<li>
							I conclude, along with archaeologists, that the nation of Israel did not emerge during
							the escape from Egypt and migration to a lost homeland, but instead was consolidated
							when regional groups supported a national army intended to resist imperial military
							threats
						</li>
						<li>
							Genetic studies connecting people in contemporary Lebanon with skeletons found in
							Sidon, calling them "Canaanites," though of course they could be Phoenician or
							Israelite - or those Danites that kept moving around, maybe
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Religious interpretation</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Robert Allen Warrior, of the Osage Nation of American Indians, "read Exodus with
							Canaanite eyes" (209)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>What should we do with Rahab?</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Not do: Rabbi Halpern for Jewish Journal</li>
				<li>the household maintained several alliances and was open to multiple partners.</li>
				<li>
					The homeland begins in a woman's home. - Rahab exerts her autonomy in order to preserve
					the social unit of utmost importance. In this way, Rahab's household becomes a locus of
					power in the land, and the nation of Israel begins in the house of Canaan
				</li>
			</ul>
