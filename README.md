## Developing

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
